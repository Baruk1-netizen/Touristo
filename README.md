# PROJECT NAME: TOURISTO PROJECT

## INTRODUCTION
My project, Touristo, is a tourist information system designed to help visitors explore specific parks efficiently and enjoyably by providing detailed information on attractions, dining, and accommodations. The application aims to enhance the travel experience by offering personalized recommendations based on user preferences.

Touristo was created for travelers seeking a comprehensive and user-friendly guide to navigate unfamiliar cities. My personal focus was on ensuring seamless integration between the frontend and backend, and optimizing the application for both web and mobile platforms.

By developing Touristo, I aimed to create a tool that would help travelers make the most of their trips, just as I had always wished for during my own adventures.
